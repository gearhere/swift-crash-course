# swift-crash-course

A crash course material presented in code form for those who **have programming experience** and hope to learn [Swift](https://swift.org/).

Each swift file starts with comments containing a list of key points relevant to the topic, which is the name of the file.

The files can be compiled and run directly to see how these language features work, or used as a quick review or study material.
